<h1>Hi My Name is Jessica!!</h1>
<p> Here's a couple of things I love:
1. Myself: I've done alot over my years wish can be very stressful.
Here's my Linkedlin so you can see my courseload:

2. Education:
I know it may seem a bit broad, too say that but it's one of the many reasons I want to go into the TKH Fellow.
I know it may be very common to hear, but education to many people is their golden ticket out. 
For many I know, it's taking their mother or father's buisness, it's becoming a lawyer to protect their family of the injustices that 
they've survived.Like I said it's a bit broad to many. However,education is the only thing that brings me a physical value.
It's what allows me to think, escape, even when the world is damaging. When you grow up seeing your parent's be accustomed to one way 
or make certain ends not meet you will always suffice to want better. I see education as my way out. 
Now the fellowship, brings all the steps that one is to prepare for a career track in data science. When I was at GWC, I was taken into a room with white men 
they told us that at pfizer they were working with airlines to understand health conditions one may come across. One, can take any situation, and break it down 
If you take a sick kid only on left aisles on March 4, you'll find that he may have eaten penuts on the flight, however so did all the other kids on the flight.
Well what does this say about peanuts?
Kids like to snack on them, they're convinent for their nutrition. 
The power of data is the analysis you can make on how a consumer may act, the decisions we make.
Many don't realize but there's a pyschology in the decisions we make why someone might find their golden ticket as an athelete while another might be discouraged 
our minds are built to think beyond and the rationale of decisions.
TKH will allow me to make these decisions.
